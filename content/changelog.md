This page is designed so translators can copy and paste from this rendered changelog page. Or, translators can use the [Design and Develop Overview page source](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/w3c/wai-design-develop-overview/master/content/index.md).

For others, **particularly significant or substantive changes are summarized after “Significant:”**.

{::nomarkdown}
{% include box.html type="end" %}

{::nomarkdown}
{% include toc.html type="start" title="Page Contents" %}

- This will be replaced by an automatically generated TOC when using Markdown formatting.
{::options toc_levels="2,3" /}
{:toc}
